Middleware functions are functions that sit between the request and the response in an express application.
For example let's say the client wants to send data to a server, sending a whole object would be an expensive operation
so the clint serializes the data into JSON(Javascript Object Notation). The server is expecting a data object so we
can deserialize the data using express.json() middleware. This server will accept the request, run the middleware and 
return a response, so the middleware sits in the middle.  

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete and it refers to the four basic operations of persistent data storage.
These operations can be mapped to the standard http methods POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. CRUD operations are the foundation 
of most dynamic websites. 

To get access to our environment variables in the env file we use the npm package dotenv, this package loads variables into process.env. 

To protect the contents of our env file we include the env file in our .gitignore. Git ignores any files specified in this file 
and doesn't upload them to github. If you accidentally upload you env file to github and then delete it,your passwords will still be compromised 
because github keeps track of all your versions, so you must change all your compromised passwords.
